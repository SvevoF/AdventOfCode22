# Day 2

Today it was a bit of a struggle, I didn't want to make some if nesting _if_ it wasn't necessary (pun intended?).
Instead, since both the opponent's and the player's plays where consecutive, I decided to check the difference in ASCII values.

This allows to restrict the number of if statements.
Part one was easy, even if I considered that Scissors beats Rock for a while (not true, if you didn't know).
Solved that _problem_, the result was immediate.

Part 2 was basically the same, but reversed. Now we have the results and we have to play accordingly. However, the same differences between ASCII characters still hold, meaning we can simply ADD instead of making the difference.
Still, it took me 40 minutes to complete the day 2 problem, not that promising, _imho_.
