# Advent of Code 2022

A place to have all the code developed for the __Advent of Code__ event, 2022 edition.

I'll try to solve the problems in _Python_, a Language I started using an year ago for my Thesis proposal and for some other stuff, unrelated to the University.

It's my first time trying the event, so bare with me if there will be some missing stuff. 
I'm doing so (even if I shouldn't due to the tight schedule I should follow) hoping to learn more on Algorithms and to be a better developer.

Let's see if I can make it past day 1!
